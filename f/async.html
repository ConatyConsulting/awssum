<h1>Async</h1>

<p>
  Due to the fact that Node.js is non-blocking and we're doing a round trip through the internet, it's obvious that
  each and every operation in AwsSum has a callback so that you know when your result has come back.
</p>

<p>
  And as with most other async callbacks the <code>(err, result)</code> is standardised across all
  operations. Therefore, in general, the first thing to do is check whether your operation received an error. If
  everything went well you're free to use the result for whatever purpose you require:
</p>

<code>
service.Operation(function(err, result) {
    if (err) {
        console.log('An error has occurred', err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('Buckets', result);
});
</code>

<p>
  Pretty much all calls you'll ever make will look fairly similar to the one above. If you're using some kind of flow
  control library to make things easier, then I don't need to explain further since you've already figured the whole
  async+callbacks thing out. :)
