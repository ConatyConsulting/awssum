  <h1>Useful Tools</h1>

  <p>
    AwsSum is one thing and one thing only. It is a small helper wrapper around web services. One library per
    service. One function per operation. Just an easy to use interface to abstract away the differences between each.
  </p>

  <p>
    It doesn't do retries after failures and it doesn't wrap the results in objects either. This is the Node.js way. Do
    one thing simply and do it well. Combine with other modules if your needs are higher.
  </p>

  <h2>fmt</h2>

  <p>
    When trying test programs, new services or new operations, I usually write a small program to show me exactly what
    is going on. Dumping out data seems to be a little tricky sometimes since <code>console.log()</code> only shows
    down to a few levels of structure. To overcome this, use the <code>fmt</code> package, which can also be used to
    neatly display the results of your program.
  </p>

{% highlight bash %}
npm install fmt
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    As an example, you could use the following structure for some of your test programs. This structure also gives you
    the ability to do multiple operations and still have the output look nice. (Note: these kinds of programs are great
    for you to look at visually but not for another program to decipher.)
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
var fmt = require('fmt');
var awssum = require('awssum');
var amazon = awssum.load('amazon/amazon');
var S3 = awssum.load('amazon/s3').S3;

var env             = process.env;
var accessKeyId     = env.ACCESS_KEY_ID;
var secretAccessKey = env.SECRET_ACCESS_KEY;
var awsAccountId    = env.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID;

var s3 = new S3({
    'accessKeyId'     : accessKeyId,
    'secretAccessKey' : secretAccessKey,
    'region'          : amazon.US_EAST_1,
});

fmt.line();
fmt.title('s3.ListBuckets');

fmt.field('Region',          s3.region());
fmt.field('EndPoint',        s3.host() );
fmt.field('AccessKeyId',     s3.accessKeyId() );
fmt.field('SecretAccessKey', s3.secretAccessKey().substr(0, 3) + '...' );
fmt.field('AwsAccountId',    s3.awsAccountId() );

fmt.line();

s3.ListBuckets(function(err, data) {
    fmt.title('Amazon:S3:Listbuckets');
    fmt.msg("listing all the buckets (no options given) - expecting success");
    fmt.dump(err,  'Error');
    fmt.dump(data, 'Data');
    fmt.line();
});
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    There are some examples in the <code>examples/*</code> folders that you can use as the basis of your test
    programs. Feel free to copy, edit and re-use any of those.
