  AwsSum is a Node.js library written by <a href="http://chilts.org/blog/">Andrew Chilton</a>
  (<a href="https://twitter.com/andychilton">Twitter</a>). It is designed to be helpful in utilising many, extensive
  and sometimes quite different Web APIs in a consistent fashion. Which means that you don't have to deal with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Request
    <ul>
      <li>which HTTP verb to use</li>
      <li>web service endpoints</li>
      <li>how to format your input parameters (URL params, XML/JSON bodies, forms, etc)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Response
    <ul>
      <li>HTTP Status Codes</li>
      <li>getting other HTTP headers</li>
      <li>decoding the returned body (whether XML, JSON, a file or nothing at all)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is true of any web service you use through AwsSum.
</p>

<p>
  It is designed as a low level wrapper around each of the operations each Web API defines. For example, Amazon EC2 has
  (currently) 134 operations, which means there is 134 operations defined in AwsSum.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, AwsSum is ideal for being built upon. See the following projects for where AwsSum is being utilised:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/connect-stream-s3">connect-stream-s3</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/connect-error-amazon-ses">connect-error-amazon-ses</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/winston-simpledb">winston-simpledb</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/winston-sns">winston-sns</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/jsbundle-s3">jsbundle-s3</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
  And it is also being used in production in various companies around the world. Come back soon for a list,
  or <a href="https://github.com/appsattic/node-awssum/issues">let me</a> know if your company is using it. Cheers.
